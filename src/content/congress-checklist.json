Sometimes the insulted party will just want to move on and not have any further contact with someone who was coarse to them.\n- If you don't want to be called $swearword, don't behave like one.\n- Help each other out.\n- Read the Code of Conduct and all linked documents at [help.ccc.de][3] and live by it.\n- Ask if it is OK to take a picture BEFORE taking the picture.\n\n### Children\n\n- Tag your children with an easy way to reach you, like DECT.\n- Remember that they might not understand why they are in this crazy place and why you need to talk to all these people.\n- If the children are grumpy, everyone's grumpy.\n\n## ‚è∞ Things to do before traveling\n\n- Charge ALL the batteries!\n- Make backups.\n- Bonus points for even testing restore.\n- Update all the software on your devices.\n- You might want to empty your drives to make room for some COMPLETELY LEGAL media files that might be shared.\n- Put your name on your stuff, especially on things you‚Äôll likely lend to someone (power strips, cables etc). Mastodon handles make excellent name tags because people know how to contact you right away. Prefer permanent markers over stickers, for theft reasons.\n- You DID make backups of all your devices, didn't you? That includes portable computers, servers, mobile phones, tablets, navigation devices, wrist watches and all your other $gadgets.\n- Store the backups not only on the device you're backing up or another device you‚Äôre taking with you. A Swiss bank locker is good, if you have one.\n- Send a pull request to this list for all the things I did not think of.\n- Feed the guinea pigs.\n- Water your plants.\n- Clean your coffee-machine and take out the trash.\n- When bringing credit cards and not living in Germany: call your bank and have them pre-approve payments from Germany. Otherwise, your bank may decline all purchases when they don't know you're traveling and suspect fraud.\n- Stock you pantry/freezer with some food that keeps so you have something to eat when you get home (that doesn't rely on shops/restaurants being open).\n- (optional but recommended) Create account in the [congress wiki][12], [add your projects][13] and [find your assembly][14].\n\n## üì¶ Things to send\n\nStuff that you're not allowed to bring on a plane or otherwise need to send via package courier or freight train. (Depending on its size.)\n\n### Items that are explicitly forbidden to bring on a plane\n\n- Ammunition\n- Fireworks\n- Explosives\n- Lighter benzine\n- Lighter gas (Butane)\n- Matches\n- Lighters (_only_ allowed on your person)\n- Butane cartridges\n- Propane cartridges\n- Radioactive medication\n- Anything toxic\n- Lead acid batteries\n- Mercury (Quecksilber)\n- Acids\n- Bleach\n- Peroxides\n- Samsung Galaxy Note 7\n- Batteries >=100Wh\n- Self-balancing scooters (hoverboards), unless you remove the battery.\n- (Strong) rare-earth magnets (really small and weak magnets, like the needle of a compass, are okay)\n\n### Not allowed or often problematic on flights, or at least not in hand luggage\n\n- All kind of blades\n  - Knives, even small pocket knives\n  - This includes nail files over 6cm, for some reason\n- Lockpicking equipment\n- Handcuffs\n\n### Items _only_ allowed to be carried _on your body_, but _neither_ in checked in luggage nor hand luggage.\n\n- Small lighters (one per person)\n\n## üéí Things to pack\n\n### Decoration\n\n- Bring ridiculous amounts of LED strips and other photon emitting devices so we can illuminate ALL the things.\n- Bring battery-powered LEDs/EL-wire/etc to illuminate yourself in the dark (but try not to blind others).\n\nThis applies to the Congress Center as well as your hotel windows.\n\n### Documents\n\n- Train/plane tickets (including verification documents for self-printed DB tickets.

Optionally other ways to reach you as well. Normally simple DIN A4 paper strips with the information printed on is enough. No need to get fancy.\n\n### Payment stuff\n\nWhen using ATMs/Cash Machines/Bankomaten/Geldautomaten give them a good wiggle before inserting your card.

Better to have too much than not enough with you ;-)\nSome meds require papers to be allowed legally in some countries, don't forget those to spare yourself unnecessary hassle by authorities. In Germany these are all drugs listed in [Appendix III][44] to the [Bet√§ubungsmittelgesetz][45] (e.g. ritalin, medical uses of marihuana). You need [this form][46], filled out and signed by your local doctor.\n\n### Clothing\n\nCome as you are, as a friend.\n\n- At least ONE clean shirt for each day you stay, plus two for traveling to and from congress (nerdy print is always welcome)\n- At least ONE set of clean underwear for each day you stay, plus two for traveling to and from congress (Doesn't necessarily need to be in matching pairs, but that is up to you.)\n- At least ONE pair of clean socks/stockings/tights/overknees for each day you stay, plus two for traveling to and from congress (again, matching pairs optional)\n- Enough pants/skirts/trousers/dresses/etc. so you can wear clean clothes every day you attend congress (even if somebody accidentally (or intentionally) spills a beverage all over you!)\n- Cycling shorts.

(Mastodon handle and DECT numbers have proven to be working well.)\nIn case something gets lost it can find its way back to you.\n\n#### Power and Chargers\n\nStart charging your batteries right now so they're ready when you finish packing and leave.\n\nFor travelling abroad there is a handy [World Electrical Plug & Socket Map][40]\n\n- Charger for laptop\n  - Mac: small Duck-head and long ([Schuko Plug][6]) cord\n  - Mac: MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Adapter\n  - Mac: There are also cords that you can plug directly into the MagSafe charger (when removing the duck head) that end in a [Euro Plug][8]. These cables are also often used on electric shavers\n    - Mac: USB-C type connector/charger\n- Plug adaptor from your country of origin to [Schuko Plug][6]\n- 3x to 10x multi-plug power extension (230V AC @50Hz) with [Schuko Plug][6] (and optional switch, hotel rooms usually suffer from severe lack of outlets)\n- Simple extension cord (230V AC @50Hz, [Schuko Plug][6], the power outlet in your hotel room may be far away from your bedside)\n- Chargers for all those phones, or at least matching cables if you can charge over USB.\n  - iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad, iPad 2, iPad 3 (The new iPad)\n    - USB-A to 30 Pin dock connector (one each)\n  - iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, iPhone 6+, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S+, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, iPhone 7+, iPad 4, iPad mini, iPad mini 2 with retina display, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 2, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro\n    - USB-A to Lightning (one each)\n  - most Android phones (and other exotic stuff like WP, Firefox OS, etc)\n    - micro USB cable, or\n      - USB-C cable (to USB A or USB-C)\n    - DECT phones\n      - Charging cradle (with power brick if required)\n- Smart Watches\n  - Charging cable or docking station required to charge\n- A portable battery pack (aka powerbank) so you can charge on the go.

(VeraCrypt, GPG, FileVault, EncFS, Bitlocker, gbde, geli, dm-crypt, LUKS, eCryptFS) - Make a GPT Label or Volume label with your online nickname or handle because people can't read your owner.txt file on encrypted devices. You may also create multiple partitions (plaintext and encrypted ones).\n  - If physically possible, add an actual label (just write on it/add a tag) with your nick on it ‚Äì many people will be rightfully hesitant to plug in a found USB stick.\n  - make note of the filesystem used so you know if they will work on the system of the person you want to exchange data with. (FAT32 is a safe bet to work everywhere, for larger files ExFAT should also work on most platforms.)\n  - Mac: NTFS can be read, but not written to without 3rd party software. FAT, ExFAT, HFS+(J), HFSX are fine for current OS X versions, ZFS, Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 and NTFS r/w support need 3rd party software.

There are many excellent tips in there or consult you local [CryptoParty][33] meetup, CCC ERFA or hackspace friends.\n\n### Backups\n\nMake fresh backups of ALL the devices you bring to CCCongress. Test that you can actually restore data from those backups!\nHave something to backup your laptop on site as well.\n\n### PowerOn/BIOS/EFI Password\n\nMake sure you do have set a BIOS or EFI Password to prevent booting from a live CD to attack your system.\n\n### Full disk encryption\n\nActivate full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication. (Mac: Activate FileVault, FreeBSD: GELI, Linux: Cryptsetup, Windows: ~~Windows? S'SLY?~~ VeraCrypt)\n\nMake sure your system does suspend to disk (SSD) and not to RAM, so you can't extract the passphrase from RAM via Firewire/Thunderbolt/ColdBoot attack.\n\n### Backups\n\nYou did make fresh backups of all your devices, did you?\n\n### Servers\n\nCheck that _all_ your server services are using proper TLS. See [bettercrypto.org][15] or other sources you trust for help on how to properly configure your servers. (Mail, Web, VPN, SSH, etc.)\n\n### VPN tunnel\n\nHave at least one trusted, working and tested VPN endpoint available for tunneling out of the congress network. If you don't have your own VPN server at your disposal, ask friends you trust to help you out. If you do, ask your friends if they need a VPN endpoint and share!\n\n- [WireGuard][146]\n- [OpenVPN][16]\n- L2TP/IPSec/IKEv2\n- [SSH][18]\n- [SSHuttle][9]\n- [iodine][17] (DNS tunnel for those pesky for-pay captive portal WiFi networks)\n- [Tor/Vidalia][19]\n\nDon't use PPTP, IKEv1, PSK VPNs anymore, they're known to be insecure.\nMake sure your VPN works with IP and Legacy IP without leaking DNS and other traffic.\n\nAlso have those tunnels configured on ALL the devices you intend to use on the local network of the venue, and have it tested. That includes your laptops, phones, tablets, servers, fridge, etc.\n\n### Phones\n\nIt is not recommended to connect your smartphone to the congress wifi -- if you still can't resist, here are a few things to consider:\n\n- Make sure that it's **not a 802.11b** device, as it would slow down the complete wifi network.\n- Disable all synchronization services, as they might be using plaintext.\n- Disable all auto-discovery services (network music players, remote control apps, etc ‚Ä¶).\n- Make sure there are no known exploits for your device (not that unknown-to-you exploits wouldn't be a possible risk as well‚Ä¶).\n- Turn off push notifications.\n- Update your apps, especially your browser.\n- Use a VPN tunnel if possible.\n- Use a Firewall and only allow the (few) services you trust.\n  - [DroidWall][22] for Android (root required)\n- If you don't have a VPN tunnel available, you can use [OnionBrowser][7] (iOS) or [Orbot][orbot] (Android) to surf via Tor (which may be its own kind of risk).\n- Set your GSM network selection to **manual** or you might end up connected to a rogue GSM network.\n\n**If you are unsure** if there are still some services transmitting plaintext data, **do not connect**.\n\n### Pre-paid SIM Cards\n\nMake sure you get a for your GSM mobile phone!\nIf you need help with buying a SIM card, ask a local for assistance. They're friendly!\n\nSince citizens from the EU can now use their dataplan while roaming within the EU, consider using that if you can. Keep in mind that you may travel through countries that are not part of the EU where you may get charged enormous amounts. You want to turn off mobile data while travelling through those countries.\n\nThese SIM cards have proven to work well if you need one. When in doubt, ask people who are local to the country of the venue. They surely can recommend a good prepaid SIM to get.\n\n### Wifi connection\n\nWIFI connections are identified by their SSID. Some operating systems automatically reconnect to known WIFI networks by default.\nMake sure that your OS is not configured to automatically connect to any networks automatically (for example \"OEBB\" or \"Wifi-on-ICE\" for Austrian and German public transport networks respectively), otherwise your device might be tricked into connecting to a malicious network.\n\n## üì´ Staying up-to-date\n\nMost events publish a lot of information about events as they happen. There are many ways to stay in the loop during the event or in between by subscribing to RSS feeds, Twitter accounts, Mastodon accounts, mailing lists and even newsletters [sic].\nFor a list of CCC related news sources you may be interested in following, see 'CCCongress Info Channels.md' in this repository.\n\n## üîô For when you return home\n\n- Store chocolate/chips/crisps at home as an post-event depression antidote\n- Make notes during CCCongress to watch all the lectures you missed on site because you were attending an awesome workshop or were having interesting conversations with people.\n- Contact the cool people you met at the event\n- Look for related local events and communities\n\n### Resources\n\n- [CongressChecklist](https://github.com/MacLemon/CongressChecklist)\n\n"
