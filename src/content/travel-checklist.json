In my case, I had a 24-hour layover in LAX because there was only a single flight to New Zealand available every day.\n- Always pack the important stuff inside your carry-on luggage (e.g. passport, prescription medication).\n- It's good to have at least one set of clothes and underwear in your carry-on in case you get laid over for more than 12 hours and would rather leave your checked-in luggage at the airport.\n\n### Resources\n- [travel-checklist](https://github.com/jpcaparas/travel-checklist)\n\n"
